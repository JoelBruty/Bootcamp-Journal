        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>For the first week, we started with the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript - Dot Notation</li>
            <li>JavaScript - Variables and Operators</li>
            <li>JavaScript - if else</li>
            <li>JavaScript - Arrays</li>
            <li>JavaScript - Functions</li>
            <li>Employability - CVs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p>We started off with JavaScript, beginning with the basics - dot notation (syntax) and commands such as console.log, console.table, Math.round and so on.</p>
        <img src="./asset/image/week1/dotnotation.png" alt="Dot Notation">

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p>We had a look at using variables with console.log to log sentences, and the different ways that you could do that: with quotation marks (" or '), with backticks (`) on one line, and using multiple lines to output the text on multiple lines.</p>

        <p>And then we had to try using variables to do set tasks.</p>

        <br>
        <img src="./asset/image/week1/variablesactivity3.png" alt="Variables Activity 3">
        <p>Finally, we had a look at if else statements</p>
        <img src="./asset/image/week1/ifelse1.png" alt="If/Else 1">
        <br>
        <img src="./asset/image/week1/ifelse2.png" alt="If/Else 2">
        <br>
        <img src="./asset/image/week1/ifelse3.png" alt="If/Else 3">

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <p>We had a look at if else statements again with some challenges, and then started to have a look at arrays and loops.</p>

        <h3>Friday</h3>
        <p>We started on functions, did some activities on it, and then started to do our challenges for it which were to be submitted.</p>
