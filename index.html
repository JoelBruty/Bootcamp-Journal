        <h2>Welcome to my journal</h2>
        <p>This is where I'll be making notes on the work that I am doing on the Software Developer Bootcamp.</p>
        <h2>What I have previously done</h2>
        <p>I have previously done IT subjects in school and finished a BTEC Level 3 Diploma in IT in college, having
            already done some programming in C# with Visual Studio as part of it as well as other units.</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p></p>
        <h2>My targets</h2>
        <p>My aim is to learn about more specialised programming languages/tools and to get a job. Currently on the
            bootcamp I have learnt some
            JavaScript, SQL, covering HTML and CSS again, and how to use GitHub to publish code in a repository (how you'll be seeing this).</p>
