        </ul>
        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p>EventListeners - We had a look at creating a KeyCode JS application that would show the key pressed and the information about it.</p>
        <p>This was in prepartion for the drumkit task, where we would need to use something like this.</p>

        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p>We worked on our own on programming paradigms.</p>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p>We started the drumkit task.</p>

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <p>We had a look at Relation Databases, possible issues with Flat File databases and Normalising (splitting up a large table with many columns to several tables that are focused around a specific item/purpose).</p>

        <h3>Friday</h3>
        <p>We continued to work on the drumkit task and uploaded our work to GitHub to submit.</p>
