        <p>For the fourth week, we've had a look at doing presentations and JS Engine. Will be looking at Multi Table SQL next.</p>

            <li>Lighting Talks</li>
            <li>JavaScript JS Engine & Execution Context / Call Stack</li>
            <li>JavaScript Scope and Higher Order</li>
            <li>JavaScript Async and Await</li>
            <li>Multi Table SQL</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <p>We chose a topic to create a presentation, which we will present this Friday and next Friday (split across both days).</p>
        <p>For my topic, I'm basing it around the Nintendo Network shutdown, which was two weeks ago from this point.</p>
        <p>Then we had a quick introduction to JS Engine and Execution Context, how we can see the order that functions are executed in.</p>

        <h3>Tuesday</h3>
        <p>Multi Table SQL</p>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p>We had a look at the Scope and Higher Order, and then had a look at Async/Await and how it affects the order that code is executed in.</p>

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <p>We worked on an SQL database project today. We had a brief of what the database is for and sample data to use when creating our tables. We had to normalise the data to 3NF, put it into tables and do some CRUD operations and queuries using said tables.</p>

        <h3>Friday</h3>
        <p>We had a look at classes and subclasses in JavaScript, and then in the afternoon I had done my presentation on the Nintendo Network shutdown.</p>
